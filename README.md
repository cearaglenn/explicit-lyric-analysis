# Explicit Lyric Analysis

Inspiration: There are many opinions that songs now have more explicit words than songs in the past.

What I'm Gonna Do: I will perform an explicit word count across 7 decades to find if there is any truth to the statement above.

TLDR - I found that the later decades (2000s vs 2010s) did indeed include more explicit words compared to earlier decades. The 2000s had the most explicit words found per songs (average: 1.73 words, median: 1 word). When compared to the 1950s, the 2000s significantly had more explicit words in the lyrics.
